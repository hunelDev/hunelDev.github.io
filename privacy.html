      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h2>1. Why is my information needed?</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is mobile based and is therefore required to store a small
        amount of information about you, your usage, and metadata associated
        with your form and spreadsheet.
      </p>
      <h2>
        2. What information does Form Approvals gather/track and how is it used?
      </h2>
      <p>
        PERSONAL INFORMATION: The only personal information we store is the
        add-on administrator's email address. Upgrading to a paid plan requires
        us to also collect billing and payment information via one of our PCI
        compliant payment processing partners such as Stripe. We
        <u>do not</u> store your form response data and we <u>do not</u> store
        your approval records. Your form response data is stored by Google in
        your spreadsheet as part of normal Google Forms functionality. We add
        the approval records to the same spreadsheet and access the information
        from the spreadsheet using the authorization that you provide to the
        service. Further details about the add-on's authorization can be found
        on our
        <a href="https://formapprovals.com/security/" target="_blank">Security Overview.</a>
        BUSINESS INFORMATION: The application stores file metadata (e.g your
        Google Form Id and Google Sheet Id) to be able to process the
        information received from workflow participants. SECURITY INFORMATION:
        Form Approvals may collect certain standard information about your
        computer for security and identification purposes. This information may
        include: IP addresses, domain names, access times, cookies and other
        unique identifying information. This information is used for the
        operation of the service, to identify and protect our customers and to
        control unauthorized use or abuse of our services. We will not view any
        of your information except as necessary to appropriately support the
        service, for the purpose of anticipating, diagnosing, supporting or
        resolving any problems that might limit or disrupt the quality of our
        customers’ service experience or as required by law. We will retain your
        information for as long as your account is active, as needed to provide
        you services, to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes,
        and enforce our agreements. We do not share your personal information to
        third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <h2>3. With whom does Form Approvals share the information?</h2>
      <p>
        Ensuring your privacy is important to us. We <u>do not</u> sell, trade or rent
        your personal information to third parties. Form Approvals products and
        services by necessity require us to provide some of your information to
        third parties. Examples include processing credit card payments (if
        applicable) and sending email (if you choose to have emails sent from
        our domain). They may have access to personal information needed to
        perform their functions and may not use it for any other purpose. Form
        Approvals does not control the practices of our affiliates. If you have
        questions about how affiliates use the information gathered when you
        link to them, please read their privacy policies.
      </p>
      <h2>
        4. How does Form Approvals protect my information from loss, misuse or alteration?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Form Approvals has implemented commercially reasonable precautions designed to protect the web sites and applications it hosts and the information it collects from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, we store as little information as possible, we cryptographically hash personal information where possible, and we logically separate all user's data.
        Since Google Forms stores all form responses in the Google Sheet that is linked to your form and Form Approvals adds all approval records in the same spreadsheet, we strongly recommend that at least two people in your organization have access to this spreadsheet and that ownership is transferred to a new user if the current owner's account is ever planned to be deleted. In the interest of your privacy, we <u>do not</u> store a backup of this data.
      </p>
      <h2>5. Does Form Approvals comply with Google's policies?</h2>
      <p>
        Form Approvals has been through several reviews by Google and is subject to ongoing reviews each time a change is made to the application or a change is made to the authorizations used. The application has been through Google's OAuth Client Verification review and Add-on review. In addition, we maintain strict compliance with Google API Services: User Data Policy and Google APIs Terms of Service.
      </p>
      <h2>6. Does Form Approvals comply with other data privacy legislation?</h2>
      <p>
        Form Approvals has reviewed and is in compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). As a service provider to a large number of educational institutions, we have designed the application to store minimal data and maintain strict compliance with the legislations on data that is processed by the application.
      </p>
      <h2>
        7. How long does Form Approvals retain data?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Form Approvals retains data while your account is active or until you ask us to delete the data. An account is deemed to be inactive when there are no form submissions processed by the add-on for 12 months. We do not delete data from your Google Form or Google Sheet.
      </p>
      <h2>8. Can I stop the add-on accessing my data?</h2>
      <p>
        By toggling the add-on OFF on each of your forms, the add-on will no longer run when new form submissions are made. In addition, you can remove the add-on's authorization to your account at any time via <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">Google's third party app permissions page</a>. By removing the authorization the add-on will no longer be able to access your files and therefore prevent any of your users from using the add-on (including your requestors and recipients).
      </p>
      <h2>
        9. Can I request that my data is deleted?
      </h2>
      <p>
        In accordance with GDPR, CCPA and other global legislation you have a 'right to be forgotten'. If you wish to cancel your account and have all your data removed, follow these steps in the order provided:
        <ul>
            <li>On each of your forms, open the add-on > click the question mark icon (in the bottom right corner) > click Restore defaults > then click the Restore defaults button. This will disable the add-on and delete all add-on settings data from your form (e.g recipient email addresses). We cannot perform this step for you.</li>
            <li>
                Remove the add-on's authorization to your account via <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">Google's third party app permissions</a> page;
            </li>
        </ul>
